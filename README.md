# TurnBasedStrategy
A learning process, this is a turn based strategy game project along the lines of Xcom and Gears Tactics that I'm using to relearn unity and maybe someday transforming into a fully fledged game.

Credit where credit is due - Thanks to Game Programming Academy on youtube for his excellent Tactics tutorial which served as the base to this project
